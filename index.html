    <h3><p style="text-align:left;">About SOS</p></h3>
    <p><p style="text-align:left;">Summer Organizing School (SOS) is a collective project to teach, train, and organize members from across universities and unions with the practical skills and political education to refuse austerity politics that place profit over people. SOS is a platform for free online classes and skills training facilitated by undergraduate and graduate students and instructors from universities in the New York area in coordination with local organizations. We seek to build and strengthen our collective capacity—as students, librarians, food service workers, custodial staff, clerical workers, contract faculty, and more—to reimagine and reconstruct the university. We will teach, learn, and share experiences as a practice of mutual aid. We are not here to fill the gaps in what the corporate university fails to provide. We are here to build and realize new visions of education, community support, political education, and consciousness raising.</p>

  <div id="principles">
    <h3><p style="text-align:left;">Statement of Principles</h3>
    <h4>We adhere to the following principles:</h4>
    <h5>Anti-racism</h5>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">SOS recognizes and seeks to deconstruct systems of white supremacy within universities, community organizations, and labor unions through anti-racist political education. We know that anti-racist principles are lived out interpersonally and structurally. How we treat, care, listen to and learn from one other must start from an anti-racist politic.</p>
    <h5>Gender Justice</h5>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">SOS is inspired by the feminist principles of care and collective responsibility. We know that teaching and learning are essential labor in the social reproduction of our communities. We practice education as an act of mutual aid to enact a more equitable and democratic model of education. We stand against the corporate university that expropriates all of our labor, and particularly the labor of of women, queer, and trans people, especially when they are Black, Indigenous, non-citizens, or poor. We do not fetishize productivity and academic burnout, but practice an ethics of care centering the most precarious among us. Classes will be organized to account as much and as collectively as possible for our time limitations, including family responsibilities, and personal health.</p>
    <h5>Accessibility</h5>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">SOS is committed to breaking down the walls of the ivory tower that exclude individuals and communities from higher education. Our courses and communications will remove barriers imposed by profit-driven universities. Within our capacity, we will produce transcripts, translations and visual descriptions for course materials. Courses will use accessible, non-specialist language, varied formats (reading groups, discussion groups, lectures, etc.) and make time for critical explanation and questioning of concepts and materials.</p>
    <h5>Anti-capitalism</h5>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Private universities in the US reproduce class differentiation and racial hierarchy, solidifying professional and interpersonal ties among the white and wealthy while relying on large volumes of underpaid and unacknowledged labor. Universities are often among the largest local employers and hold tremendous amounts of property. SOS will develop mechanisms to redistribute academic and material resources by building mutual aid networks to develop collaboration and solidarity amongst workers. We refuse the university’s enforced distinctions between academic workers and clerical, custodial, and technical workers.</p>
    <h5>Abolition</h5>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">SOS recognizes that colleges and universities not only maintain meaningful connections to local police, prisons and private security forces, but that universities also harbor cultures and policies of anti-blackness. We are committed to upholding an abolitionist framework which understands that the use of both campus and local forces at education facilities do not keep us safe.</p>
    <h5>Accountability</h5>
    <p>SOS maintains a commitment to collective, transparent and caring resolution of issues brought up by participants. We recognize and seek to address racism, sexism, and all other avenues of discrimination within the US labor movement and our own union(s) and organization(s). Our commitment to accountability structures recognizes that we all have the capacity to harm one another and seeks to develop collective responses to community conflict. Accountability measures include weekly orientations and debriefs on class instruction and participation, talk-back sessions, and anonymous reporting to ensure that the SOS team adheres to this statement of principles. Summer school activities will dedicate space and time for other participants to weigh in, present ideas, challenge instruction, etc.</p>
